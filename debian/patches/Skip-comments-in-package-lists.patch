Subject: Skip comments in package lists

Comments in package lists used to work in live-build 3.x (although
possibly only as a side-effect of some other logic) and being able to
comment package is a useful feature (to explain why some packages are
included and to make it easy to uncomment some lines to add more useful
packages).

This patch has been merged in live-build 5.x.
